Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I've been into long-distance running and it changed my life. Never before was I so active and it has been a miracle for my mental health. My first running race ever was the 2020 Lululemon Half-marathon in Toronto, which I finished in 2:00:33 hrs. Here are all the races I've run since:
