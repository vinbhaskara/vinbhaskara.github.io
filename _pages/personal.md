Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I've been into long-distance running! It's had the greatest influence on my mental health and social life. My first race was the 2020 Lululemon Half-marathon in Toronto which I completed in 2:00:33 hrs. Here are all the races in reverse chronological order I've run since! :-)  

2025 - [Montreal Beneva Marathon 42.2k](https://couronsmtl.com/en/marathon-beneva/home/) (5:23:24)  
2023 - [21k de Mtl Half-marathon](https://mtlmarathon.com/en/) (1:56:10)  
2022 - [Chicago Marathon](https://www.chicagomarathon.com/) (3:58:45)  
2022 - [The San Francisco Marathon](https://www.thesfmarathon.com/) (4:16:04)  
2022 - [Around the Bay 30k Hamilton](https://bayrace.com/) (3:16:17)

My best 42.2 km marathon finish time to date is 3:56:49 hrs.  
I am planning to run my first (and likely the last!) 50 km ultra-marathon soon sometime in 2025!
